Lighthouse in stormy seas.
Cyberpunk alleyway, rain-soaked streets, neon signs casting vibrant reflections.
Coastal cliff at sunset, waves crashing on rugged rocks.
A bustling city square where people walk in every direction, street performers entertaining the crowd.
Beneath the sea, colorful coral reefs teem with fish, and sunlight filters through the water, creating an ethereal glow.
An ancient temple shrouded in mist, incense smoke curling upward as worshippers bow.
In a cyberpunk cityscape, flying cars streak past neon signs, reflections shimmer on the wet streets, and a robotic vendor skillfully hands out steaming food with its mechanical arm at the street corner.
Inside the space station, a robot is operating the control panel.
A nighttime plaza with a fountain lit by changing colors and couples strolling under the stars.
A busy train station with trains arriving and departing, passengers rushing to catch their trains, and the sounds of announcements in the air.
A grand festival at night with fireworks lighting up the sky and people dancing in the streets.
Auroras dance in the Arctic night sky, bands of green, purple, and blue intertwining in the high air like giant ribbons swaying in the wind, reflecting shimmering light off the snow-covered lake.
